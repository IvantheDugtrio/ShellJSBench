# ShellJS Benchmarks

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shelljs/benchmarks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shelljs/benchmarks)

Collection of benchmarks for ShellJS

This is a comparison of [ShellJS]() and bash for performance. Each test case
runs scripts with equivalent output and compares Bash's runtime with ShellJS's.
Surprisingly, ShellJS is often the winner, sometimes being up to **12x faster**!
Woohoo! See below for [ShellJS performance wins](#shelljs-performance-wins).
